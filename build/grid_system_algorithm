PROBLEM: BUILD A GRID SYSTEM.

The proposed grid system must be made up of rows where in each row a total of 12
columns can be created.
Classes representative of a kind of column must be created for each type of column.
The grid should allow the user the ability to offset columns whenever needed.
Class names will each start with the keyword Grid(in lowercase) followed by row for rows and
followed by col for columns, furthermore, the keyword 'col' should be followed by a number representative
of the size of the needed column.
Grid offsets should also start with the keyword Grid followed by keyword offset that will then be followed by a
number specifying the offset length.




ALGORITHM:

1. Define a row class that can be applied to any element.
	the class should have declarations for: width,max-width,vertical gutter and background-color
2. Define a class for each type of colum:
	for each column, create declarations for: width,horizontal gutter,floats.

	2.1 If the class name contains 12, make the class fill up the parent's(row) entire width,else if
		it contains 11,
